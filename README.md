# Git/GitHub as a Genome Version Comparison Tool
- Git permits the user to visualise the differences between the nucleotides of genome versions using the command: `git diff --color-words=.`. However, this can only be performed on the command-line as GitHub does not support the visualisation of difference across large files.
- The user has no capacity to lift-over FASTA sequence data to dependent files (vcf, gff, SAM, etc.).
