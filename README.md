# Git/GitHub as a Genome Version Comparison Tool
*Git permits the user to visualise the differences between the nucleotides of genome versions using the command: git diff --color-words=. However this can only be performed on the command-line, GitHub is unable to visualise the differences. 
*The user has no capacity to lift-over FASTA sequence data to dependent files (vcf,gff,SAM,etc.)
